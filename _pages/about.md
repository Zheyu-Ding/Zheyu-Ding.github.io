I'm a third year master student. My research interest includes bioinformatics, omics, translation regulation, and ribosome profiling.

I graduated in 2022 from the [School of Pharmacy](https://pharm.hainanu.edu.cn/), Hainan University, with a Bachelor's degree in Pharmaceutical Engineering. In September 2022, I entered the [School of Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.hznu.edu.cn/), Hangzhou Normal University, to pursue a Master's degree in Pharmacy. From September 2023 to March 2025, I am a visiting student at the [Dieter A. Wolf Lab](https://www.dieter-wolf-lab-westlakeuniversity.cn/), [School of Medicine](https://medicine.westlake.edu.cn/About/Overview/), Westlake University.

I’m actively seeking opportunities to pursue a Doctor’s degree starting from Fall 2025.
