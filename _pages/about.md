I'm a Ph.D candidate at [cancer cell plasticity lab](https://www.ssshen.com/) under West China Hospital, [Sichuan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_University). There, I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof.Shensi Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a-R0vSQAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My research interest includes systems biology, bioinformatics, translation regulation, and ribosome profiling.

I got B.S. degree from [School of Pharmacy](https://pharm.hainanu.edu.cn/), [Hainan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hainan_University) in 2022.

Wolf Lab](https://www.dieter-wolf-lab-westlakeuniversity.cn/), [School of Medicine](https://medicine.westlake.edu.cn/About/Overview/), [Westlake University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westlake_University).
