Drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells represent a major obstacle to achieving durable cancer remission, yet their biology and clinical relevance remain poorly understood. This perspective highlights key gaps hindering the translation of DTP research into clinical progress, emphasizing the need to move beyond reductionist models toward integrative, patient-aligned approaches that reflect clinical complexity. Bridging these divides will be crucial to reveal actionable biomarkers and develop therapies capable of eradicating these resilient cell populations.
