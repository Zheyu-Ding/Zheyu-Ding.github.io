Protein synthesis from mRNA is an energy-intensive and strictly controlled biological process. Translation elongation is a well-coordinated and multifactorial step in translation that ensures the accurate and efficient addition of amino acids to a growing nascent-peptide chain encoded in the sequence of messenger RNA (mRNA). Which undergoes dynamic regulation due to cellular state and environmental determinants. An expanding body of research points to translational elongation as a crucial process that controls the translation of an mRNA through multiple feedback mechanisms. Molecular chaperones are key players in protein homeostasis to keep the balance between protein synthesis, folding, assembly, and degradation. Chaperonin-containing tailless complex polypeptide 1 (CCT) or tailless complex polypeptide 1 ring complex (TRiC) is an essential eukaryotic molecular chaperone that plays an essential role in assisting cellular protein folding and suppressing protein aggregation. In this review, we give an overview of the factors that influence translation elongation, focusing on different functions of molecular chaperones in translation elongation, including how they affect translation rates and post-translational modifications. We also provide an understanding of the mechanisms by which the molecular chaperone CCT plays multiple roles in the elongation phase of eukaryotic protein synthesis.
